Time-based metadata alignment

Metadata evaluation parameters:
    time-optimized metadata mapping
        max gap between matching metadata events = 1 sec
        max extent to match for SU's = 0.5 sec

Speaker Diarization evaluation parameters:
    The max time to extend no-score zones for NON-LEX exclusions is 0.5 sec
    The no-score collar at SPEAKER boundaries is 0 sec

Exclusion zones for evaluation and scoring are:
